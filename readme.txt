Add social stats to the Dashboard and "Edit" pages of the WordPress admin.

== Description ==

A very lightweight plugin to add social stats to the Edit Post page and Dashboard of the Wordpress admin. Simply install the plugin and it does the rest. No settings or any manipulation needed!

Post Admin Social Stats adds a metabox to each post and page that shows the like/share count from select social networks. A metabox is also added to the Dashboard for likes/shares of the top-level home URL. This plugin is designed to have a small footprint as to not interfere with the front-end of the site.

== Installation ==

1. Upload '/post-admin-social-stats/' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to change any settings to customize this plugin for my site? =

No. Post Admin Social Stats automatically determines the permalink of the post/page you are viewing, so settings are not required.
